# MLB-24-Pitching-Visualzation-Script-for-R
A script that visualizes data to compare MLB level pitchers from every team to the league average depending on stat
If you do not want to run the script on your own you I have attached the final resoults

INCLUDED BELOW:

Packages to install in your R-Project,(Just press download)
Data set to use (2024 season only, you can use your own if you wish),
Vsiualization script (plug into R), 
When the chart comes up you might have to auto scale and then zoom in as it will look like the stats are all on the average line(when you hover over them they will show you the true stat...working on fix for this.

NOTICE:

If you decide to use your own stats file you will need to edit the # Load data (line 7) so that it matches your csv file.
If using your own csv make sure the stats in the script match the stats in the file.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING YOUR OWN CSV, THIS SCRIPT WAS MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FILE ATTATCHED**
